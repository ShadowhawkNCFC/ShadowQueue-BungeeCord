# ShadowQueue-BungeeCord

ShadowQueue is a BungeeCord and Spigot plugin that enables players to be placed into a queue for a gamemode or server. It can be used if a server is at capacity,
or to entice donations to enter into a priority queue.

Headline features
> Priority queue system, allowing those that donate / have a particular rank to skip the queue. <br /><br />
> Admin commands to push players to certain positions in queue. <br /><br />
> (Coming Soon) Upon reaching the front of the queue, spreading players across multiple target servers. <br />

Note: The Spigot version of this plugin MUST also be installed on all servers used as either a target or a shooter.
